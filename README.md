# About

This app is heavily inspired by a [Traversy Media tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFDcZABiDQ). I wanted to test my current React skills before watching his tutorial about Hooks and Context API.

Basically the aim of the app is to track expenses through user input. It displays the item number, description and amount in History and updates Balance. Only accepts valid numbers in the amount input field (along with **$** and **-** for negatives). Amounts are displayed without dollar signs.

Let me know if there are any errors or bugs. Still learning so any feedback/code review would be much appreciated!

### Background

Initially, I had completed the tic-tac-toe tutorial on ReactJS website and read their guide, watched various YouTube videos and read half of the [The Road to React](https://roadtoreact.com/) by Robin Wieruch.

### Learned

- React function and class components.
- JavaScript ES6 (classes, arrow functions, ternary operator, map, filter, etc.).

### To do

☐ Enhance UI/make it pretty (CSS).  
*Optional*  
☐ Extra additional features (see App.js comments at bottom).  
☐ Implement the ErrorBoundary component.  
*Next step*  
☐ Watch the tutorial and implement it with Hooks and Context API.
